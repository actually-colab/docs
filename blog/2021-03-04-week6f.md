## Frontend

- [x] Integrated `@nteract`'s Open Source outputs component to replace my manual version. This added support for more output types at a slight trade off of speed and bundle size. The main benefit is a big boost to maintainability, don't need to reinvent the wheel for rendering complex outputs
- [x] Implemented the kernel panel with logs of when various actions occurred
- [x] Keep trying to connect to the kernel periodically in case the user doesn't start it till after
- [x] Detect a kernel disconnect and connect to a new kernel if it dies
- [x] Added support for `LaTeX` in `markdown`
- [x] Added a help panel that explains how to setup the kernel as well as common issues for displaying output with things like `matplotlib` and `pandas`
