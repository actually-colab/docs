## Frontend

- [x] Display error message notifications
- [x] Show the collaborator's name on their cursor when they are typing
- [x] Auto render markdown on unlock
- [x] Move code execution queue to the `ReduxKernel` middleware instead of the `useKernel` hook
- [x] Deterministically choose a color for each user for their cursor, cell borders, and avatar borders
