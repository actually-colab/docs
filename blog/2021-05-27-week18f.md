## Frontend

- [x] Darkened the user colors to make them more readable
- [x] Display a connecting modal when reconnecting to the socket client
- [x] Show a popover list of users when more than 3 users are active to conserve editor header space
- [x] Added user avatars and names to the kernel selector to make it more obvious who users are
- [x] Simplified the UI by reducing clutter in the left sidebar and moving the kernel and profile to the header
