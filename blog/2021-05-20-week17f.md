## Frontend

- [x] Rewrote the editor header to improve performance
- [x] Improved the UI for the kernel selector to make it more intuitive and obvious to the user when they are viewing another user's outputs
- [x] Replaced Ace with Monaco as the underlying code editor used for cells
- [x] Added code completions powered by the Jupyter Kernel
