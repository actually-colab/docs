## Frontend

- [x] Started separating the electron application into a web hosted frontend and a smaller native kernel manager. This decreases our native platform dependency because our core client is available via a browser regardless of platform. This even allows it to be run on an iPad.
- [x] Moved authentication directly into the client since redirects are no longer necessary with a web app
- [x] Added support for markdown cells with syntax highlighting and rendering as markdown
- [x] Stripped down the newly forked [`desktop-launcher`](https://github.com/actually-colab/desktop-launcher) into a minimal kernel process manager
- [x] Secured the Kernel Gateway by automatically setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header depending on if it is dev or prod

### Todo

- [ ] Complete migration to the web app with improvements to the kernel connection now that it isn't triggered via IPC
- [ ] Provide information to the user on how to setup the native kernel manager or run the Gateway independently on platforms that aren't natively supported by the new [`desktop-launcher`](https://github.com/actually-colab/desktop-launcher)
