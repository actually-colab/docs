We created a repo here https://github.com/actually-colab not much interesting yet, but @jtaylorchang got a 
proof of concept frontend working that you can write code into and then it will execute against the Jupyter 
kernel locally. This is a part we thought would be harder but Jeff persevered to get a demo of it working.

Still a ton of work to flesh that out into a fully featured notebook UI though and we haven't started on 
getting the actual code collaboration part working. Going to write up a doc soon to plan out the features.
