## Frontend

- [x] Separated the notion of a "selected" cell from a "locked" cell. This allows the run button to be able to advance without locks
- [x] Added the ability to queue cell executions that way you can start a bunch of jobs and walk away
- [x] Allowed the user to interrupt a cell execution. If a cell gets carried away or you accidentally start a long process, you can stop at any time
- [x] Added the ability to disconnect from a kernel as well as disable auto connecting
- [x] Users can now export their project to the `ipynb` format which could be used in `jupyter`, `Google Colab`, turned in as a deliverable, etc.
- [x] Integrated the get/create notebook REST endpoints from `@actually-colab/editor` so users can create and see a list of notebooks
- [x] Converted the cells and outputs to nested Immutable maps and lists to improve performance and avoid mutating the redux store
