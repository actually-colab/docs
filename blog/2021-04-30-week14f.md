## Frontend

- [x] Remember recently used gateway URIs so that the user can select them automatically from a dropdown
- [x] Used conditional `overflow-anchor`s to prevent scrolling from DOM updates when multiple users are typing (before, your cell could move down if someone was typing in a cell above you)
- [x] Major performance improvements as large as 10x faster UI updates from typing, locking, and unlocking
- [x] Much faster chat experience especially when there is a large number of messages

## Organizational

- [x] Got accepted to the [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource)
- [x] Got accepted to GitHub Sponsors
